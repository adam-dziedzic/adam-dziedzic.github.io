  desc: An open source project from researchers within the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data (ISTC). BigDAWG is a reference implementation of a polystore database. A polystore system is any database management system (DBMS) that is built on top of multiple, heterogeneous, integrated storage engines. I worked on the scaffolding of the system and then implemented a cast operator to move data between diverse DBMSs.
