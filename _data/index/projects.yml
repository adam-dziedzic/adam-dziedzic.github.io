  desc: "The convolutional layers are core building blocks of neural network architectures. In general, a convolutional filter applies to the entire frequency spectrum of the input data. We explore artificially constraining the frequency spectra of these filters and data, called band-limiting, during training. The frequency domain constraints apply to both the feed-forward and back-propagation steps. Experimentally, we observe that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are resilient to this compression scheme and results suggest that CNNs learn to leverage lower-frequency components. In particular, we found: (1) band-limited training can effectively control the resource usage (GPU and memory); (2) models trained with band-limited layers retain high prediction accuracy; and (3) requires no modification to existing training algorithms or neural network architectures to use unlike other compression schemes."

- name: Auto-recommendation of hybrid physical designs
  #i18n: cpython
  url: "https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3190660"
  img: static/assets/projects/hybrid-designs3.png
  desc: We extend the Database Engine Tuning Advisor for Microsoft SQL Server to recommend a suitable combination of B+ tree and columnstore indexes for a given workload. Through extensive experiments using industry-standard benchmarks and several real-world customer workloads, we quantify how a physical design tool capable of recommending hybrid physical designs can result in orders of magnitude better execution costs compared to approaches that rely either on columnstore-only or B+ tree-only designs.

  repo: bigdawg
  img: static/assets/projects/bigdawg2.png
  desc: An open source project from researchers within the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data (ISTC). BigDAWG is a reference implementation of a polystore database. A polystore system is any database management system (DBMS) that is built on top of multiple, heterogeneous, integrated storage engines. I worked on the scaffolding of the system and then implemented a cast operator to move data between diverse DBMSs.

  desc: An automated testing infrastructure was built to benchmark the loading performance of several commercial and open-source databases, perform an in-depth analysis to identify bottlenecks of the data loading process and investigate novel techniques which could be used to accelerate DBMS data loading.
