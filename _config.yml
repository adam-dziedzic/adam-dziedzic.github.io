  desc: I'm a PhD student at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. Aaron Elmore. I'm passionate about empowering users with data driven decisions. My research was focused on data loading and migration between diverse database systems and I worked on the BigDAWG project. I was an intern at Microsoft Resaerch and worked on recommendation of hybrid physical designs (B+ tree and Columnstores) for SQL Server. Currently, I work on intersection of databases and machine learning. I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Warsaw University of Technology in Poland. I was also studying at DTU (Technical University of Denmark) and carried out research on databases in the DIAS group at EPFL, Switzerland. Previously, I had internships at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), Barclays Investment Bank in London (UK), Microsoft Research (Redmond, USA) and Google (Madison, USA). I spend the rest of my waking hours on reading books, taking MOOC courses, especially on Machine & Deep Learning, enjoying many sports, playing a guitar and practising some dances.  # Describe yourself.
