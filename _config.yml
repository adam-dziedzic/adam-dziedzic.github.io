  desc: My goal is to empower users with data driven decisions. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Vector Institute and the University of Toronto, advised by Prof. Nicolas Papernot. I earned my PhD at the University of Chicago, where I was advised by Prof. Sanjay Krishnan and worked on the Band-Limited convolutional neural networks, the DeepLens project as well as the out-of-distribution robustness of pre-trained transformers. My previous research was focused on data loading and migration between diverse database systems within the framework of the BigDAWG project. I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Warsaw University of Technology in Poland. I was also studying at DTU (Technical University of Denmark) and carried out research on databases in the DIAS group at EPFL, Switzerland. I was a PhD intern at Microsoft Research and worked on recommendation of hybrid physical designs (B+ tree and Columnstores) for SQL Server. I also had internships at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), Barclays Investment Bank in London (UK), Microsoft Research (Redmond, USA) and Google (Madison, USA). I spend the rest of my waking hours on reading books, taking MOOC courses, especially on Machine & Deep Learning, enjoying many sports, playing a guitar, and practicing martial-arts.  # Describe yourself.
