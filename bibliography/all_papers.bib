To address these challenges, we introduce a polystore, BigDAWG, that tightly couples diverse database systems, data models, and
query languages through use of semantically grouped Islands of Information. BigDAWG, which stands for the Big Data Working
Group, seeks to provide location transparency by matching the right system for each workload using black-box model of query and
system performance. In this paper we introduce BigDAWG as a solution to diverse web-based interactive applications and motivate
our key challenges in building BigDAWG. BigDAWG continues to evolve and, where applicable, we have noted the current status of
its implementation.},

    abstract = {Data loading has traditionally been considered a one-time deal - an offline process out of the critical path of query execution. The architecture of
DBMS is aligned with this assumption. Nevertheless, the rate in which data is
produced and gathered nowadays has nullified the one-off assumption, and has
turned data loading into a major bottleneck of the data analysis pipeline.
This paper analyzes the behavior of modern DBMSs in order to quantify their
ability to fully exploit multicore processors and modern storage hardware during
data loading. We examine multiple state-of-the-art DBMSs, a variety of hardware
configurations, and a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets to identify bottlenecks in the data loading process and to provide guidelines on how
to accelerate data loading. Our findings show that modern DBMSs are unable to
saturate the available hardware resources. We therefore identify opportunities to
accelerate data loading.},

 transaction processing, decision support, and operational analytics. They also support
 variety in physical design structures such as B+ tree and columnstore. The benefits

 However, the importance of hybrid physical designs, consisting of both columnstore
 and B+ tree indexes on the same database, is not well-studied --- a focus of this
 paper. We first quantify the trade-offs using carefully-crafted micro-benchmarks.
 This micro-benchmarking indicates that hybrid physical designs can result in orders
 of magnitude better performance depending on the workload. For complex real-world
 applications, choosing an appropriate combination of columnstore and B+ tree indexes
 for a database workload is challenging. We extend the Database Engine Tuning Advisor
 for Microsoft SQL Server to recommend a suitable combination of B+ tree and columnstore
 indexes for a given workload. Through extensive experiments using industry-standard
 benchmarks and several real-world customer workloads, we quantify how a physical design
 tool capable of recommending hybrid physical designs can result in orders of magnitude
 better execution costs compared to approaches that rely either on columnstore-only
 or B+ tree-only designs.},

Experimentally, we observe that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are resilient to this compression scheme and results suggest that CNNs learn to leverage lower-frequency components. In particular, we found: (1) band-limited training can effectively control the resource usage (GPU and memory); (2) models trained with band-limited layers retain high prediction accuracy; and (3) requires no modification to existing training algorithms or neural network architectures to use unlike other compression schemes.},

In many contexts, such as healthcare and finance, separate parties may wish to collaborate and learn from each other's data but are prevented from doing so due to privacy regulations. Some regulations prevent explicit sharing of data between parties by joining datasets in a central location (confidentiality). Others also limit implicit sharing of data, e.g., through model predictions (privacy). There is currently no method that enables machine learning in such a setting, where both confidentiality and privacy need to be preserved, to prevent both explicit and implicit sharing of data. Federated learning only provides confidentiality, not privacy, since gradients shared still contain private information. Differentially private learning assumes unreasonably large datasets. Furthermore, both of these learning paradigms produce a central model whose architecture was previously agreed upon by all parties rather than enabling collaborative learning where each party learns and improves their own local model. We introduce Confidential and Private Collaborative (CaPC) learning, the first method provably achieving both confidentiality and privacy in a collaborative setting. We leverage secure multi-party computation (MPC), homomorphic encryption (HE), and other techniques in combination with privately aggregated teacher models. We demonstrate how CaPC allows participants to collaborate without having to explicitly join their training sets or train a central model. Each party is able to improve the accuracy and fairness of their model, even in settings where each party has a model that performs well on their own dataset or when datasets are not IID and model architectures are heterogeneous across parties.},

S-Store also acts as an intelligent router that sends input tuples to the appropriate components of BigDAWG. All updates to S-Store's shared memory are done in a transactionally consistent (ACID) way, thereby eliminating new errors caused by non-synchronized reads and writes. The ability to migrate data from component to component of BigDAWG is crucial. We have described a migrator from S-Store to Postgres that we have implemented as a first proof of concept.

Our system, DeepLens, is based on dataflow query processing systems and this research prototype presents initial experiments to elicit important open research questions in visual analytics systems. One of our main conclusions is that any future "declarative" VDMS will have to revisit query optimization and automated physical design from a unified perspective of performance and accuracy tradeoffs. Physical design and query optimization choices can not only change performance by orders of magnitude, they can potentially affect the accuracy of results.},

We contribute a detailed experimental evaluation that elucidates these questions and benchmarks perturbation defenses in a consistent way. In particular, we show five main results: (1) all input perturbation defenses, whether random or deterministic, are essentially equivalent in their efficacy, (2) such defenses offer almost no robustness to adaptive attacks unless these perturbations are observed during training, (3) a tuned sequence of noise layers across a network provides the best empirical robustness, (4) attacks transfer between perturbation defenses so the attackers need not know the specific type of defense only that it involves perturbations, and (5) adversarial examples very close to original images show an elevated sensitivity to perturbation in a first-order analysis.

In this work, we focus on the LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) specification developed by the LTE-U Forum, which uses the duty-cycle approach for fair coexistence. The specification suggests reducing the duty cycle at the LTE-U base-station (BS) when the number of co-channel Wi-Fi basic service sets (BSSs) increases from one to two or more. However, without decoding the Wi-Fi packets, detecting the number of Wi-Fi BSSs operating on the channel in real-time is a challenging problem.

It is relatively straightforward to observe only the energy values during the LTE-U BS OFF time compared to decoding the entire Wi-Fi packet, which would require a full Wi-Fi receiver at the LTE-U base-station. We implement and validate the proposed ML-based approach by real-time experiments and demonstrate that there exist distinct patterns between the energy distributions between one and many Wi-Fi AP transmissions. The proposed ML-based approach results in a higher accuracy (close to 99% in all cases) as compared to the existing auto-correlation (AC) and energy detection (ED) approaches.}

Deficits in deep paraspinal neck muscles may be related to early onset ASD. This study aimed to determine whether the morphometry of preoperative deep neck muscles (multifidus and semispinalis cervicis) predicted early onset ASD in patients with ACDF. Thirty-two cases of early onset ASD after a two-level ACDF and 30 matched non-ASD cases were identified from a large-scale cohort. The preoperative total cross-sectional area (CSA) of bilateral deep neck muscles and the lean muscle CSAs from C3 to C7 levels were measured manually on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Paraspinal muscle CSA asymmetry at each level was calculated. A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to identify demographic, radiographic, and/or muscle parameters that predicted proximal/distal ASD development. No significant between-group differences in demographic or preoperative radiographic data were noted (mean age: 52.4 ± 10.9 years). ACDFs comprised C3 to C5 (n = 9), C4 to C6 (n = 20), and C5 to C7 (n = 32) cases. Eighteen, eight, and six patients had proximal, distal, or both ASD, respectively. The SVM model achieved high accuracy (96.7\%) and an area under the curve (AUC = 0.97) for predicting early onset ASD. Asymmetry of fat at C5 (coefficient: 0.06), and standardized measures of C7 lean (coefficient: 0.05) and total CSA measures (coefficient: 0.05) were the strongest predictors of early onset ASD. This is the first study to show that preoperative deep neck muscle CSA, composition, and asymmetry at C5 to C7 independently predicted postoperative early onset ASD in patients with ACDF. Paraspinal muscle assessments are recommended to identify high-risk patients for personalized intervention.},

Yet, the implications of audio adversarial examples on these real-world systems remain poorly understood given that most research targets limited defenders who can only listen to the audio samples. Conflating detectability of an attack with human perceptibility, research has focused on methods that aim to produce imperceptible adversarial examples which humans cannot distinguish from the corresponding benign samples. We argue that this perspective is coarse for two reasons: 1. Imperceptibility is impossible to verify; it would require an experimental process that encompasses variations in listener training, equipment, volume, ear sensitivity, types of background noise etc, and 2. It disregards pipeline-based detection clues that realistic defenders leverage. This results in adversarial examples that are ineffective in the presence of knowledgeable defenders. Thus, an adversary only needs an audio sample to be plausible to a human. We thus introduce surreptitious adversarial examples, a new class of attacks that evades both human and pipeline controls. In the white-box setting, we instantiate this class with a joint, multi-stage optimization attack. Using an Amazon Mechanical Turk user study, we show that this attack produces audio samples that are more surreptitious than previous attacks that aim solely for imperceptibility. Lastly we show that surreptitious adversarial examples are challenging to develop in the black-box setting.}

    abstract = {In federated learning (FL), data does not leave personal devices when they are jointly training a machine learning model. Instead, these devices share gradients with a central party (e.g., a company). Because data never "leaves" personal devices, FL is presented as privacy-preserving. Yet, recently it was shown that this protection is but a thin facade, as even a passive attacker observing gradients can reconstruct data of individual users. In this paper, we argue that prior work still largely underestimates the vulnerability of FL. This is because prior efforts exclusively consider passive attackers that are honest-but-curious. Instead, we introduce an active and dishonest attacker acting as the central party, who is able to modify the shared model's weights before users compute model gradients. We call the modified weights "trap weights". Our active attacker is able to recover user data perfectly and at near zero costs: the attack requires no complex optimization objectives. Instead, it exploits inherent data leakage from model gradients and amplifies this effect by maliciously altering the weights of the shared model. These specificities enable our attack to scale to models trained with large mini-batches of data. Where attackers from prior work require hours to recover a single data point, our method needs milliseconds to capture the full mini-batch of data from both fully-connected and convolutional deep neural networks. Finally, we consider mitigations. We observe that current implementations of differential privacy (DP) in FL are flawed, as they explicitly trust the central party with the crucial task of adding DP noise, and thus provide no protection against a malicious central party. We also consider other defenses and explain why they are similarly inadequate. A significant redesign of FL is required for it to provide any meaningful form of data privacy to users.},

To prevent model stealing, existing defenses focus on detecting malicious queries, truncating, or distorting outputs, thus necessarily introducing a tradeoff between robustness and model utility for legitimate users. Instead, we propose to impede model extraction by requiring users to complete a proof-of-work before they can read the model's predictions. This deters attackers by greatly increasing (even up to 100x) the computational effort needed to leverage query access for model extraction. Since we calibrate the effort required to complete the proof-of-work to each query, this only introduces a slight overhead for regular users (up to 2x). To achieve this, our calibration applies tools from differential privacy to measure the information revealed by a query. Our method requires no modification of the victim model and can be applied by machine learning practitioners to guard their publicly exposed models against being easily stolen.},

    abstract = {Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an increasingly popular ML paradigm that trains models to transform complex inputs into representations without relying on explicit labels. These representations encode similarity structures that enable efficient learning of multiple downstream tasks. Recently, ML-as-a-Service providers have commenced offering trained SSL models over inference APIs, which transform user inputs into useful representations for a fee. However, the high cost involved to train these models and their exposure over APIs both make black-box extraction a realistic security threat. We thus explore model stealing attacks against SSL. Unlike traditional model extraction on classifiers that output labels, the victim models here output representations; these representations are of significantly higher dimensionality compared to the low-dimensional prediction scores output by classifiers. We construct several novel attacks and find that approaches that train directly on a victim's stolen representations are query efficient and enable high accuracy for downstream models. We then show that existing defenses against model extraction are inadequate and not easily retrofitted to the specificities of SSL.},

Because of their versatility in downstream applications, they are increasingly used as a service exposed via public APIs. At the same time, these encoder models are particularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high dimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain undefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on supervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership in the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an encoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently trained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As part of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen encoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without involving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and distance measurements. Our extensive empirical results in the vision domain demonstrate that dataset inference is a promising direction for defending self-supervised models against model stealing.},

    abstract = {Applying machine learning (ML) to sensitive domains requires privacy protection of the underlying training data through formal privacy frameworks, such as differential privacy (DP). Yet, usually, the privacy of the training data comes at the cost of the resulting ML models' utility. One reason for this is that DP uses one uniform privacy budget epsilon for all training data points, which has to align with the strictest privacy requirement encountered among all data holders. In practice, different data holders have different privacy requirements and data points of data holders with lower requirements can contribute more information to the training process of the ML models. To account for this need, we propose two novel methods based on the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework to support the training of ML models with individualized privacy guarantees. We formally describe the methods, provide a theoretical analysis of their privacy bounds, and experimentally evaluate their effect on the final model's utility using the MNIST, SVHN, and Adult income datasets. Our empirical results show that the individualized privacy methods yield ML models of higher accuracy than the non-individualized baseline. Thereby, we improve the privacy-utility trade-off in scenarios in which different data holders consent to contribute their sensitive data at different individual privacy levels.},

    abstract={Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) APIs provide ready-to-use and high-utility encoders that generate vector representations for given inputs. Since these encoders are very costly to train, they become lucrative targets for model stealing attacks during which an adversary leverages query access to the API to replicate the encoder locally at a fraction of the original training costs. We propose *Bucks for Buckets (B4B)*, the first *active defense* that prevents stealing while the attack is happening without degrading representation quality for legitimate API users. Our defense relies on the observation that the representations returned to adversaries who try to steal the encoder's functionality cover a significantly larger fraction of the embedding space than representations of legitimate users who utilize the encoder to solve a particular downstream task. B4B leverages this to adaptively adjust the utility of the returned representations according to a user's coverage of the embedding space. To prevent adaptive adversaries from eluding our defense by simply creating multiple user accounts (sybils), B4B also individually transforms each user's representations. This prevents the adversary from directly aggregating representations over multiple accounts to create their stolen encoder copy. Our active defense opens a new path towards securely sharing and democratizing encoders over public APIs.},

    abstract={Collaborative machine learning (ML) is widely used to enable institutions to learn better models from distributed data. While collaborative approaches to learning intuitively protect user data, they remain vulnerable to either the server, the clients, or both, deviating from the protocol. Indeed, because the protocol is asymmetric, a malicious server can abuse its power to reconstruct client data points. Conversely, malicious clients can corrupt learning with malicious updates. Thus, both clients and servers require a guarantee when the other cannot be trusted to fully cooperate. In this work, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) learning scheme that is secure against malicious servers and robust to malicious clients. Our core contribution is a generic framework that transforms any (compatible) algorithm for robust aggregation of model updates to the setting where servers and clients can act maliciously. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our approach even with 1-million parameter models trained by 100s of peers on standard datasets.},

abstract={Large language models (LLMs) are excellent in-context learners. However, the sensitivity of data contained in prompts raises privacy concerns. Our work first shows that these concerns are valid: we instantiate a simple but highly effective membership inference attack against the data used to prompt LLMs. To address this vulnerability, one could forego prompting and resort to fine-tuning LLMs with known algorithms for private gradient descent. However, this comes at the expense of the practicality and efficiency offered by prompting. Therefore, we propose to privately learn to prompt. We first show that soft prompts can be obtained privately through gradient descent on downstream data. However, this is not the case for discrete prompts. Thus, we orchestrate a noisy vote among an ensemble of LLMs presented with different prompts, i.e., a flock of stochastic parrots. The vote privately transfers the flock's knowledge into a single public prompt. We show that LLMs prompted with our private algorithms closely match the non-private baselines. For example, using GPT3 as the base model, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 92.7\% on the sst2 dataset with strong differential privacy guarantees vs. 95.2\% for the non-private baseline. Through our experiments, we also show that our prompt-based approach is easily deployed with existing commercial~APIs.},

This budget represents a maximal privacy violation that any user is willing to face by contributing their data to the training set. We argue that this approach is limited because different users may have different privacy expectations. Thus, setting a uniform privacy budget across all points may be overly conservative for some users or, conversely, not sufficiently protective for others. In this paper, we capture these preferences through individualized privacy budgets. To demonstrate their practicality, we introduce a variant of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) which supports such individualized budgets. DP-SGD is the canonical approach to training models with differential privacy. We modify its data sampling and gradient noising mechanisms to arrive at our approach, which we call Individualized DP-SGD (IDP-SGD). Because IDP-SGD provides privacy guarantees tailored to the preferences of individual users and their data points, we find it empirically improves privacy-utility trade-offs.},

abstract={Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently received significant attention due to its ability to train high-performance encoders purely on unlabeled data---often scraped from the internet. This data can still be sensitive and empirical evidence suggests that SSL encoders memorize private information of their training data and can disclose them at inference time. Since existing theoretical definitions of memorization from supervised learning rely on labels, they do not transfer to SSL. To address this gap, we propose SSLMem, a framework for defining memorization within SSL. Our definition compares the difference in alignment of representations for data points and their augmented views returned by both encoders that were trained on these data points and encoders that were not. Through comprehensive empirical analysis on diverse encoder architectures and datasets we highlight that even though SSL relies on large datasets and strong augmentations---both known in supervised learning as regularization techniques that reduce overfitting---still significant fractions of training data points experience high memorization. Through our empirical results, we show that this memorization is essential for encoders to achieve higher generalization performance on different downstream tasks.},
